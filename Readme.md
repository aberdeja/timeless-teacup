#Timeless Teacup

This is a website that is meant to represent an online storefront for a fake product. The Timeless Teacup in particular is designed to represent a shop that sells different types of teas. This website utilizes a combination of HTML and CSS in it's design. The goal of this website is to be made available on any browser. However, at the moment, the most compatible browser is Chrome.
